# Python-Compiler-With-GUI
A simplified compiler built with Python and Tkinter that walks through all major phases of compilation, including **lexical analysis**, **parsing**, **semantic checks**, and **code generation**. A GUI is provided to enhance user interaction and visualize the compilation process.

##  Features

This project implements:

1. **Lexical Analysis**  
   - Tokenizes the input using regular expressions.

2. **Syntax Analysis**  
   - Recursive descent parser builds the parse tree.

3. **Semantic Analysis**  
   - Type checking and semantic validation (e.g., float promotion).

4. **Intermediate Code Generation**  
   - Converts parse tree into intermediate representation (IR).

5. *Code Optimization**  
   - Simplifies IR for improved performance.

6. **Code Generation**  
   - Generates mock assembly code or pseudo-assembly.

7. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
   - Built with Tkinter to input expressions and display compilation results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI interaction
- **binarytree** – for representing and visualizing parse trees
